# Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain:
- `icon.ico` - Main application icon (32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128 sizes)
- `installer_image.bmp` - Large installer wizard image (164x314 pixels)
- `installer_small.bmp` - Small installer wizard image (55x58 pixels)

## Creating Icons

### Application Icon (icon.ico)
- Use an icon editor or online converter
- Include multiple sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128
- Weather-related theme (cloud, sun, hoodie)
- Professional appearance

### Installer Images
- `installer_image.bmp`: 164x314 pixels, 24-bit color
- `installer_small.bmp`: 55x58 pixels, 24-bit color
- Should match your application branding
- Keep simple and clean for professional appearance

## Temporary Solution
If no custom icons are available, the installer will use default Windows icons.
The application will still function perfectly without custom icons.
